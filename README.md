 Data-Analysis-Sakila DataBase Project
 In my inaugural venture into the realm of data analysis, I undertook a comprehensive project using the Sakila database, delving deep to extract valuable insights. The exploration encompassed a multifaceted analysis, including a meticulous examination of weekly churn patterns, RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation for customer profiling, and a thorough assessment of customer frequencies. Additionally, I conducted a nuanced regional analysis, pinpointing the most revenue-generating countries and cities. As the narrative unfolded, I dived into the intricacies of customer behavior, providing personalized movie recommendations. This endeavor not only honed my analytical skills but also showcased the transformative power of data in unraveling intricate patterns and informing strategic decision-making.
